Details for teaching team

All functions working as described by project requirements. I used least code possible to create simple and easy application. All logic sits in Controllers and a little bit of database code in Model. I utilized View inheritance by breaking project apart into smaller parts. Basic Routes provide clean website breakdown. Used Illuminaty package for forms as suggested by instructor. 

Outside code
